# Todo List
This is a simple To-Do List made with React.


## The approach taken.

*  function that stored value from input .
* function to make a cope tasks inside array .  
* Checked function on list to know which task done .




## Future extensions.
create an new options that allowed users to save list in time, update, and reminder by time .
