# Todo List
This is a simple To-Do List made with React.


## The approach taken.

* Function that stored value from input .
* Function to make a copy of tasks inside array .  
* Checked function on list to know which task done .




## Future extensions.
Create a new options that allowed users to save list in time, update, and reminder by time .
